Ecology.  Arcology + causeways.
Contact + relations.  Security.
Wildlife.  Artilects.  Natives.

What are the tradeoffs involved in this game?
  The packing problem of placement of services and infrastructure while
  accomodating aura structures.
  The personnel you choose to recruit, their personalities, and which missions
  you send them on at what times.
  The schools you invest in and large-scale politics, which become an
  increasingly binding commitment.

//  THESE WILL HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED LATER, I THINK

Public Bounty    Screened        Covert
(Just Cash)     (Priority)  (Not Advertised)

Priority:  Idle, Casual, Routine, Urgent, Critical
            100    250     500     1000    2500

Bribery.  Loyalty.  Coercion.  (This is stuff that really becomes important in
The Late Game.  Early on, simple cash rewards will usually do the job.  But for
really high-stakes or long-term away missions, you need hard guarantees of
commitment from people well past caring about money.)

  Action takes place on the planet of Diaspora (AKA Bloodstone AKA Presidium.)
  20 sectors.  6 initially claimed.  2 as neutral ground (mostly deep oceans
  and rad zones.)  That leaves 12 sectors up for grabs with unique associated
  quests and production bonuses.
  
  (Place-names taken after Mars)

How do I divide up the planet's surface?  ...Wait.  You have 20 sectors.  6 +
12 + 2.  Alternatively... 12 sectors.  Dodecahedral projection.  ...I like that
better, I think-
